First attempt at building the front-end of a task tracking application. 
Used HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS.
Skills learned:
- HTML5, CSS3, JS Basics
- 
- Flex vs Grid
- CSS custom properties
- Node.js and NPM
- DOM manipulation
- Advanced querey selectors
- Capture and Bubbling
- Forms/form validation
- Chrome debugging
- Proto Object (prototype inheritance)
- Design patters:
  - JS Objects and object constructors
  - Factory Functions
  - Closure
  - Module Pattern
  
Problem with this project/future learning:
- The main problem with this project that made me retire it (for now). The app was too tightly coupled. The UI and logic were tied together.
More thought needs to be put into the design patterns and independent systems to ensure scalability and reliability.
